Mouse Cursor Control Using Facial Movements

An assistive computer vision project that enables mouse control via **facial gestures** using Python and ML models.

##  Tech Stack
- Languages:** Python
- Libraries:** OpenCV, Dlib, PyAutoGUI, scikit-learn
- Models:** SVM, CNN

## Features
- Real-time facial detection and tracking
- Cursor movement and click simulation through facial gestures
- Highly accurate gesture recognition using ML models

##  Results
- Achieved **92% recognition accuracy**
- Reduced interaction time by **60%** vs standard keyboard navigation

##  Run
git clone https://github.com/lokeshthalluru/mouse-curser-control-using-facial-moments.git
python facial_mouse_control.py
